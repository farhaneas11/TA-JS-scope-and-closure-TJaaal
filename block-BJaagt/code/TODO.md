Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

Example:

```js
function hello() {
  var username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // output
```

In above code we are looking for the variable named `usename`. There is no variable named `username` in the global scope. The variable is inside the function named `hello` and we can't access the variable defined inside a function from outside.

The above code will throw an error `Reference Error username is not defined`.

```js
{
  const username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // output
```
username not defined.

3. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

if (true) {
  let username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // output
```
username not defined.
